ii:
program 1:
CYCLES = 10 * n + 1

program 2:
CYCLES = 14 * n + 1

program 3:

iii:
program 1: CPI = (10n / 5n) = 2 for large n

program 2: CPI = (14n / 9n) = 1.56 for large n

program 3: CPI = (12n / 5n) = 2.4 for large n

iv:
A cycle can be saved at the end of each iteration if the hardware finds a way to "move up" the write being done in index 3.
This would allow for the value to be read 1 cycle earlier by the initial load at the start of each iteration except for the first.
Alternatively, the read in the pipeline could be moved to a later time, or the hardware could find a means of forwarding the instruction
into the intial load.
